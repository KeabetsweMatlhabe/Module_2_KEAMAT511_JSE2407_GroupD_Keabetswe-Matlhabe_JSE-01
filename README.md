Dynamic Star Ratings: The application displays star ratings for products based on their average rating fetched from the API.

Product Modal: Clicking on a product opens a modal that shows detailed information about the product, including a larger image, description, and price.

Add to Cart and Wishlist: Users can add products to their cart and wishlist by clicking the respective buttons.
